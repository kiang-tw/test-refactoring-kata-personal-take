# Test Refactoring Kata

Welcome to test refactoring kata! In this codebase we aim to provide you with some codebase where you can practice your test improvement skills and, if necessary, code refactoring skills to made your envisioned "test refactoring" the reality. The majority of the codebase had some test coverage but if you look into the code itself you might see some surprises on the test itself. It's up to you to decide which one constitute test smell and how you can improve it. Like a normal kata, there is no black and white answer. The practice is the point itself.
